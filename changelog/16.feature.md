+ include support for polynomial-decay (besides cosine-decay)
+ we added three new classes/functions to the API in the module `convergence`
  + `PolynomialDecaySplineHelper`
  + `PolynomialDecaySplineHelperDerivative`
  + `get_polynomial_decay_harmonised_spline`
+ whereby the function `get_polynomial_decay_harmonised_spline` is mainly meant as user-interface
  This function can be used as value for the `get_harmonise_spline` parameter in `harmonise`.
  The function takes the same arguments as `get_cosine_decay_harmonised_spline` and additionally a
  `power` argument.
+ The `power` argument can be passed to the function using
  `functools.partial(get_polynomial_decay_harmonised_spline, power=2)`
+ An example use-case is added to the `getting-started-tutorial`.
