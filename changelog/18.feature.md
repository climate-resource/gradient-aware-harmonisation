+ include support for logistic-decay
+ we added three new classes/functions to the API in the module `convergence`
    + `LogisticDecaySplineHelper`
    + `LogisticDecaySplineHelperDerivative`
    + `get_logistic_decay_harmonised_spline`
+ whereby the function `get_logistic_decay_harmonised_spline` is mainly meant as user-interface
  This function can be used as value for the `get_harmonise_spline` parameter in `harmonise`.
  The function takes the same arguments as `get_cosine_decay_harmonised_spline` and additionally a
  `slope` and `shift` argument.
+ These arguments determine slope and location of the logistic function and can be passed using
  `functools.partial(get_logistic_decay_harmonised_spline, slope = 0., shift = 0.)`
+ An example use-case is added to the `getting-started-tutorial`.
