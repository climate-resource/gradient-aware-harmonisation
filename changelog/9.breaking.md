Adjusted argument variables to new interface in which we moved from
manipulating timeseries to manipulating splines by considering that
a "constant" can also be represented as a spline.

First attempt to implement a domain for the Spline but currently
implementation is unsatisfactory. Requires domain specification for
SplineScipy and SumOfSplines in gradient_aware_harmonisation.spline
